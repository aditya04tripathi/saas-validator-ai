  gnosis: {
    meaning:
      "Gnosis (γνῶσις) is an ancient Greek word meaning 'knowledge' or 'insight'—particularly knowledge gained through direct experience and understanding, rather than just theoretical learning. In my context, Gnosis represents the deep, actionable knowledge that entrepreneurs gain when they truly understand their startup idea's potential, market fit, and path to success.",
    origin:
      "Derived from the Greek verb 'gignōskō' (to know), Gnosis embodies the transformative power of knowledge that comes from validation, analysis, and genuine insight into what makes a startup idea viable.",
  },
  vision: {
    title: "My Vision",
    content:
      "To empower every entrepreneur with the knowledge and insights needed to transform their startup ideas into successful businesses. I envision a world where no great idea goes unvalidated, and every entrepreneur has access to the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions about their venture.",
  },
  mission: {
    title: "My Mission",
    content:
      "To democratize startup validation by providing AI-powered, accessible, and comprehensive analysis tools that help entrepreneurs understand their ideas' potential. I strive to bridge the gap between having an idea and having a validated, actionable plan by offering deep insights into market potential, competition, feasibility, and execution strategies—making the path to startup success clearer and more achievable for everyone.",
  },
  why: {
    title: "Why I Built Gnosis",
    content:
      "Starting a business is challenging, and many great ideas fail not because they're bad ideas, but because entrepreneurs lack the resources and insights to validate and refine them before investing significant time and money. Traditional validation methods are expensive, time-consuming, and often inaccessible to early-stage founders. I built Gnosis to change that. By leveraging AI technology, I've created an affordable, accessible platform that provides comprehensive startup validation and planning—giving every entrepreneur the knowledge (gnosis) they need to succeed. My goal is to help founders make informed decisions, reduce risk, and increase their chances of building something truly impactful.",
